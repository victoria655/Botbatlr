# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Description
Welcome to BotBattlr, a fun and interactive app where you can collect, manage, and deploy a variety of bots! Build your own bot army, organize bots based on their class, and choose your favorite bots to fight for you. You can add them to your army, view their stats, and discharge them if needed!

### Key Features
1.Bot Collection: View a list of bots, filter them by class (e.g., Medic, Assault, Defender, etc.), and search for specific bots by name or weapon.

2.Bot Details: Click on a bot to see its full details, including stats like health, damage, and armor.

3.Add to Army: Select bots to add to your army. If a bot is already in your army, you’ll be notified.

4.Manage Your Army: View the bots in your army and remove them if you wish. You’ll be asked for confirmation before discharging a bot from your army.

5.Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
1. Bot Collection
Users can view a list of bots with their names, images, and descriptions.

Users can search for bots by name or weapon.

Users can filter bots by class.

2. Bot Details
Clicking a bot shows its detailed information, including avatar, name, health, damage, armor, and catchphrase.

3. Add Bot to Army
Users can add a bot to their army from the details page.

Duplicate bots cannot be added to the army.

4. View Army
Users can view all the bots in their army, with names, images, and stats.

5. Discharge Bot from Army
Users can discharge a bot from their army with a confirmation prompt.

Discharging can be confirmed or canceled.

6. Responsive Design
The app adapts to mobile view, with a responsive layout and navigation.

7. Persistent Data
Added bots remain in the army after page refresh or app restart.

### Technologies Used
1.React: For building the user interface.

2.React Router: For navigation between pages.

3.JSON Server: For simulating a backend database to fetch and manipulate bot data.

4.LocalStorage: For persisting the bot army data in the browser across sessions.

5.CSS: For styling the app with a clean and responsive layout.
